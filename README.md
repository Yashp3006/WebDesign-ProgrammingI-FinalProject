# Final Project – Web Design and Programming I (CIS 375)

This repository contains my final project for **CIS 375: Web Design and Programming I** at Buffalo State University. The project is a multi-page personal website that demonstrates my skills in web design, layout, styling, and incorporating multimedia.

## 📝 Project Description

This website includes several themed pages: a homepage, a contact page, a restaurant-themed page, a travel page, and a miscellaneous creative page. It features custom fonts, embedded media (audio and video), styled tables, and multiple CSS files for different purposes.

The goal was to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively to create a cohesive, visually appealing, and interactive site.
